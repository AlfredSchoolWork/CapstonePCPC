Purpose:
To pick out the best setting of the Local Binary Pattern method,
by generate a series of images with different settings for human inspection.

Materials:
All the accepted images taken by tripod from black and white samples.

LBP test procedure:
1.	Manually crop all the Tripod taken pictures without the background.
2.	Set up the list of parameters for generating the Local binary pattern processed images.
3.	Put all the images both black and white into a list.
    Then generate all the necessary folders from all the parameters and the labels.
4.	Using the multiprocessing module,
    process all the images with the given parameters.
5.	Within the processing function,
    read the image then process the image for the given parameters,
    then save the image.

Observations:

1. As R value increases, the "grain" in the output images will become larger. (expected)
2. As P value increases, the "grain" in the output images will become more prominent. (expected)
3. Among the methods tested, the texture from the plate is strengthened by the default method.Purpose:
